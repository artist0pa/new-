#You are building an e-commerce application, and the system needs to support multiple payment methods. 
# Customers can choose to pay using different payment gateways like Credit Card, PayPal, or Google Pay. 
# You donâ€™t want to hard-code the payment gateway logic, so you decide to use the Factory Method Pattern 
# to dynamically select and process the payment through the appropriate gateway.
